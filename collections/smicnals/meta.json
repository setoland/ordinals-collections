    "description": "Smicnals are mysterious creatures that live in the Ordinals galaxy. There will be 33 of them at first, but the number will gradually increase. This is a completely personal project by the author @mwrote. Currently there are no utilities, but it will be further developed in the future, taking advantage of the author's abilities as a web engineer, UI designer, and voxel creator.",
