  "description": "The collection \"RecursiveDestiny\" is the first comprehensive representation of Chinese traditional culture in the form of a recursive inscription. It covers the main concepts of ancient Chinese philosophical doctrines such as the \"Book of Changes\" (\u5468\u6613), the \"Bagua\" (\u516b\u5366), the \"Yin-Yang and Five Elements\" (\u9634\u9633\u4e94\u884c), the \"Fantasy Magician\" (\u5947\u95e8\u9041\u7532), the \"Plum Blossom Divination\" (\u6885\u82b1\u6613\u6570), and the \"Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches\" (\u5929\u5e72\u5730\u652f). Through the concise collection of 60 individual characters, it showcases the traditional Chinese perspectives on moral ethics, natural observations, philosophical views, and the concept of destiny.\n\nThese doctrines hold significant importance in tracing the origins of life, exploring the relationship between humans and nature, and unveiling the connection between choices and destiny. \"RecursiveDestiny\" also conveys a profound philosophical concept: reincarnation, reflecting a simple yet profound belief system.",
