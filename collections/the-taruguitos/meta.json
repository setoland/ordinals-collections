  "description": "The story goes that some logs were stacked up as dry firewood in anticipation of a freezing winter. In a night of lightning and sparks, the little taruguitos came to life and dreamed of becoming real children. One of them learned how to use the blockchain and they became part of the Bitcoin blockchain forever.",
